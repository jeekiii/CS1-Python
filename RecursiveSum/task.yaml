    The method ``sum(list)`` returns the sum of the elements contained in ``list``.

    Example: the sum of :math:`[1, 2, 3]` is :math:`6`

    Note that your algorithm should be able to compute the sum even
    when the list ``list`` contains malicious elements (not numbers).

    Note that this question is the same question as one that was asked in the fifth session, except that we now expect you to solve it in a recursive way. The use of ``while`` and ``for`` loops will be prohibited to ensure you provide a recursive solution.
