    All your life you wondered *"Where did this stupid owl misplace my letter?"*, *"When will I finally go to Hogwarts?"* or even on the end *"Am I actually a squib?"*. Do not worry!

    **Hogwarts** finally contacted you for an important task. Even if you're too old to learn **witchcraft**, they're lucky because you learned a different kind of magic: **programming**.

    They decided to modernize a bit their admission services and want you to create a program that will be able to fill a file (template of the admission letter) with the name of a student. This way, they will be able to save on the feathers and reduce the workload of the elves!
